## Submission Details

Submissions must be written in English, prepared using the new CEUR-ART 1-column style, formatted in PDF, and submitted through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pmai25).

An Overleaf template for LaTeX users is available [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-ceur-workshop-proceedings-ceur-ws-dot-org/wqyfdgftmcfw). Alternatively, you can [download](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip) an offline version with the style files for both LaTeX and MS-Word.

PMAI 2025 invites submissions of research, industry, and application contributions.

There are two submission formats:

- _Regular papers_ (max 12 pages including an appropriate number of references): must contain enough substance that they can be cited in other publications and must not have appeared before.
- _Short papers_ (2-4 pages including an appropriate number of references): results and ideas of interest to the PMAI audience, including position papers, system and application descriptions and presentations of preliminary results, an overview of papers accepted at another conference or which you submitted or plan to submit to another conference. In the latter case, extended abstracts must clearly state the venue where the paper has been accepted or submitted alongside its status.

All accepted papers are expected to be presented at the conference and **at least one author of each accepted paper _must_ travel to the ECAI venue in person. Multiple submissions of the same paper to other ECAI workshops are forbidden.**

Submissions will be reviewed by 2-3 reviewers. Submissions should be single-blind so the names of the authors will be visible to the reviewers and should be indicated on the submitted files. 

## Camera Ready Preparation

The proceedings will be submitted to CEUR-WS.org for online publication. Papers will be published under a CC BY 4.0 license that will be included in an open-access proceedings volume of CEUR Workshop Proceedings, indexed by both Scopus and DBLP. Extended Abstracts are no longer indexed by dblp.org and the case of an abstract of a pre-published paper may require permission by the copyright holder.

<!-- ## Special Issue 

Best papers will be invited for a special issue along with best papers from sister workshops in BPM: [AI4BPM](https://sites.google.com/unitn.it/ai4bpm-2023), [BPI](https://feb.kuleuven.be/drc/LIRIS/misc/bpiworkshop), and [FM-BPM](https://fm-bpm2023.github.io/). -->
