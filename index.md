Process Management (PM) is a growing multidisciplinary discipline combining insights from computer science, operations research, and data science (cf., process mining). The extraordinary development of AI techniques and the dawning of the Generative AI (GenAI) era are paving the way toward a new generation of information systems able to “augment” process management, making them more autonomous, adaptive, intelligent, optimized, and self-explanatory. Such systems are referred to as [AI-augmented BPM systems](https://doi.org/10.1145/3576047) (ABPMS). These are AI-empowered, trustworthy, and process-aware systems that continuously reason and act on data within a set of constraints, aiming to adapt and improve one or more processes according to various indicators. Furthermore, recent advances in AI are redefining the traditional scope of business processes. Future processes will encompass a broader spectrum of activities where the sequencing of actions is crucial for achieving system goals. These processes extend beyond the conventional concept of business workflows to include a variety of manifestations such as function calls, chains of thought, causal reasoning, broader forms of logical reasoning, and multi-agent collaborations.

The development of ABPMSs may be influenced by recent advancements in ad-hoc compositions of domain expertise and [Artificial Expert Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02441) (AEI). These innovations, embodied in Agentic AI infrastructures, present both challenges and opportunities. Unlike generative AI (GenAI), Agentic AI goes further by creating intelligent agents capable of acting independently, collaborating with other agents, or interacting with humans through natural language processing. These agents demonstrate varying levels of contextual understanding, learn from past experiences, reason within defined parameters, and make decisions in complex scenarios. By harnessing the potential of diverse AI technologies, organizations could achieve unprecedented insights and capabilities, resulting in measurable business impacts and new revenue streams. The composition will broaden the scope of AI-based applications and accelerate more data-driven business processes.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers from different research disciplines and a strong interest in promoting the synergy between AI and PM to address the above frontier challenges. The AI community at ECAI, IJCAI, and AAAI, has hosted, as the birthplace of the early revolution of AI, some early events dedicated to business processes (Gamble 1998[^1]; Drabble and Jarvis 1999[^2]). And yet, the business process community has, over the years, drifted apart and found their separate home in the International Conference on Business Process Management (BPM) and, more recently, the International Process Mining Conference (ICPM). This landscape, however, is set to change as AI techniques mature and are deployed with increasing fidelity and robustness, which are required for enterprise applications. We can observe this evolving landscape in the early seeds of PMAI workshops, which aim to address the interdisciplinary gap with a significant emphasis on the vision of ABPMS. This vision has gained traction over the last three years, being showcased at [IJCAI-ECAI 2022](https://pmai-ijcai.github.io/), [IJCAI 2023](https://pmai23.github.io/), and, most recently, at [ECAI 2024](https://pmai2024.demacs.unical.it/).

We welcome scientists, practitioners, and students from academic and industrial communities interested in the synergy between AI and PM, to participate and/or submit their original work. We welcome not only contributions that empower PM with AI techniques but also contributions that exploit their combination to solve more general problems in employing AI to processes.
