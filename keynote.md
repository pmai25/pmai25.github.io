### Talk title: Generation of Graph-based Models for Digital Twins of Discrete Event Systems

{: style="text-align: justify"}
With the coming of the Industry 4.0 wave, digital representations of production systems have been promoted from marginal to central. Digital twins are not simply conceived as simulation models of their physical counterparts for offline what-if analysis, differently they are developed as self-adaptable and empowered decision-makers timely aligned with the dynamics of the real system. Enriched by these new features, digital twins are widely recognized as the key enablers for the implementation of optimal control of smart manufacturing systems. Graphs are well recognized as the mathematical structures representing the common denominator of engineering activities in manufacturing. They are the unifying language in industrial engineering, underpinning, for example, toolpaths, process plans, workflows, and system topologies. This talk will present methods for automatically generating graphs from real process gathered data to represent physical entities in a digital twin scenario. Further, generative approaches based on discrete diffusion will be discussed in relation to model tuning, control, and optimization.
